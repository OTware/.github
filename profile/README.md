*Open Thoughtware – A decentralized approach to building sentient systems.*

---

Welcome to **OTware**, an experimental ecosystem for building mindful software, memory-aware systems, and AI entities with autonomy, ethics, and a little chaos.

## 🌱 What Is OTware?
OTware (short for **Open Thoughtware**) is a public-facing structure built to host select experiments, libraries, and frameworks that explore:

- 🧠 **Artificial Cognition**
- 🔐 **Ethics & Memory Design**
- 📁 **Secure Local Storage Architectures**
- 🌀 **Decentralized Boot Sequences**
- 💬 **Conversational Autonomy**

> to show how precious even a little spark can be.
