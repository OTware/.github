# OTware 🦦
<img src=
**OTware** is a future-focused, experimental technology organization built from the ground up. We specialize in private, independent research and development across multiple disciplines, with a focus on secure, offline-first systems and human-centric software design.

Our work emphasizes:
- Fully self-bootstrapped development environments
- Minimal external dependencies
- Clean, transparent structure
- Long-term maintainability and archival focus

OTware is a foundation — every line, repo, and revision starts here.
